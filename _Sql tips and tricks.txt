- aggregate functions can be used in dense_rank 
- use sum case when for multiple where conditions
- For running total in mysql use SUM Col1 OVER(partition by Col1 order by Col2) 
Partition by dictates when the running total should be set to 0
Order by dictates the values should be add according to which column
- PIVOT SQL TABLE
  For creating summary on numeric data use sum/max with case statement https://ubiq.co/database-blog/how-to-create-pivot-table-in-mysql/
  For all string values, establish a row_number per group, then using conditional aggregation grouped by that row number:
          SELECT 
        max(case when continent = "America" then name else null end) as "America",
        max(case when continent = "Asia" then name else null end) as "Asia",
        max(case when continent = "Europe" then name else null end) as "Europe"
        from (
        select *,row_number() over(partition by continent order by name ) as rn
            from student
            order by name
        ) as T1
        group by rn
 
- COUNT(*) is all rows in the table, COUNT(Expression) is where the expression is non-null only.
- Avoid joins in "exclusion/not" based questions. Use NOT IN
