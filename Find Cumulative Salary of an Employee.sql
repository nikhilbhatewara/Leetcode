Approach: Using OUTER JOIN and temporary tables

Intuition

Solve this issue by two steps. The first one is to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months, and then exclude the most recent month from the result.

Algorithm

If you feel hard to work out how to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months, think about 2 months as a start. By joining this Employee table with itself, you can get salary information for one more month.

SELECT *
FROM
    Employee E1
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E2 ON (E2.id = E1.id
        AND E2.month = E1.month - 1)
ORDER BY E1.id ASC , E1. month DESC
Id	Month	Salary	Id	Month	Salary
1	4	60	1	3	40
1	3	40	1	2	30
1	2	30	1	1	20
1	1	20			
2	2	30	2	1	20
2	1	20			
3	4	70	3	3	60
3	3	60	3	2	40
3	2	40			
Note:

The blank value in the output is actually NULL in the database.
The first three columns are from E1, and the rest ones are from E2.
Then we can add the salary to get the cumulative sum for 2 months.

SELECT
    E1.id,
    E1.month,
    (IFNULL(E1.salary, 0) + IFNULL(E2.salary, 0)) AS Salary
FROM
    Employee E1
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E2 ON (E2.id = E1.id
        AND E2.month = E1.month - 1)
ORDER BY E1.id ASC , E1.month DESC
| id | month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 4     | 100    |
| 1  | 3     | 70     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 2     | 50     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 4     | 130    |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
Similarly, you can join this table one more time to get the cumulative sum for 3 months.

SELECT
    E1.id,
    E1.month,
    (IFNULL(E1.salary, 0) + IFNULL(E2.salary, 0) + IFNULL(E3.salary, 0)) AS Salary
FROM
    Employee E1
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E2 ON (E2.id = E1.id
        AND E2.month = E1.month - 1)
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E3 ON (E3.id = E1.id
        AND E3.month = E1.month - 2)
ORDER BY E1.id ASC , E1.month DESC
;
| id | month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 4     | 130    |
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 2     | 50     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 4     | 170    |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
In addition, we have to exclude the most recent month as required. If we have a temp table including every id and most recent month like below, then we can easily opt out these months by join it with the above table.

| id | month |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 4     |
| 2  | 2     |
| 3  | 4     |
Here is the code to generate this table.

SELECT
    id, MAX(month) AS month
FROM
    Employee
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
;
At last, we can join them together and get the desired cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months excluding the most recent one.

MySQL

SELECT
    E1.id,
    E1.month,
    (IFNULL(E1.salary, 0) + IFNULL(E2.salary, 0) + IFNULL(E3.salary, 0)) AS Salary
FROM
    (SELECT
        id, MAX(month) AS month
    FROM
        Employee
    GROUP BY id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) AS maxmonth
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E1 ON (maxmonth.id = E1.id
        AND maxmonth.month > E1.month)
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E2 ON (E2.id = E1.id
        AND E2.month = E1.month - 1)
        LEFT JOIN
    Employee E3 ON (E3.id = E1.id
        AND E3.month = E1.month - 2)
ORDER BY id ASC , month DESC
;
id	month	Salary
1	3	90
1	2	50
1	1	20
2	1	20
3	3	100
3	2	40
